			<p class="toggle-view">This is the second full redesign I have completed for the gallery since 2010. The focus of the website is to act as an online showcase for the large collection of art and memorabilia available through the gallery. The purpose for this redesign was to build an all new - fully responsive website - with a simpler, updated user flow and a fresh facelift based off of the original design.</p>
			<p class="toggle-view">I first developed an all new information architecture scheme for the product categories. I then designed the mockups and overall visual style. I went on to personally complete all front end coding, as well as developed a tailored content management system with Wordpress.</p>
			<p class="toggle-view"> The final product is an interface that makes it easy to browse the vast collection of art and memorabilia. The dark visual style is meant to compliment the “Rock Star” atmosphere of the company and it’s products.</p>
