			<p class="toggle-view">This is the second full re-design I have completed for the gallery since 2010. The focus of the website is to act as an online showcase for the large collection of art and memorabilia available form the gallery leading business goal. The purpose for this re-design was to build an all new - fully responsive website with a fresh facelift of the original design.</p>
			<p class="toggle-view">I worked solo on this project every step of the way. I developed a content strategy with the client, and designed the mockups and overall visual style. I then personally completed all front-end coding, as well as developed a tailored content management system with Wordpress.</p>
			<p class="toggle-view"> The final product is an interface that focuses on the collection of pieces and artists. The dark visual style is meant to compliment the Rock Star atmosphere of the company and products. </p>
