		<p>Hey! Im Thomas. Currently I’m the Interactive Creative Director at The Firm Graphics in Denver, CO. I have a fairly diverse background in UI & Web design as well as front-end development. I am an advocate for strong visual communication but I also believe that good design is more than just pixels on a screen.

						<h2>User Experience</h2>
						<p>These days, User Experience must be considered every step of the way, not as just one piece of the puzzle. A well devised strategy will create a solid foundation for the UX of your product. I do this by first understanding the business goals as well as anticipating users needs. </p>

						<h2>Visual Design</h2>
						<p>Since the beginning of my career, visual design has always been my main area of expertise.  I have brought many client solutions to life through beautiful interfaces. I believe that a well designed interface will help users feel comfortable with a product, and build trust with a brand. </p>

						<h2>User Interface Development</h2>
						<p>I love bringing my interfaces to life using HTML, SCSS, and jQuery, among other great tools.  Understanding how a design will be coded in the real world gives me valuable insight when working on a project.  </p>

						<h2>Art Direction</h2>
						<p>In my opinion, the role of Art Director should be hands on. As Art Director I also act as Lead Designer. Working from sketch concepts to hi-fidelity designs. I can then direct a team to see through the overall vision  of how something should look and feel.  </p>

			When I'm not obsessing over design, I’m obsessing over music or art in some way or another. You can usually find me pushing a skateboard around Denver, or spinning Techno music for my neighbors - even though they didn’t ask. Right now I’m just patiently waiting for next Year’s Red Rocks season to start.
