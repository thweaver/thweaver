		<p>Hey! Im Thomas - a Multidisciplinary Designer living in Denver, CO. I have a fairly diverse background in UI/Web design, front end development, graphic design, and branding. I am an advocate for strong visual communication, but I also believe that good design is more than just pixels on a screen.

						<h2>Visual Design</h2>
						<p>Since the beginning of my career, visual design has always been my main area of expertise.  I have brought many client solutions to life with beautiful interfaces. I believe that a well designed interface will help users feel comfortable with a product, and build trust with a brand. </p>

						<h2>Front End Development</h2>
						<p>I love to develop my interfaces using HTML, SCSS, and Javascript/jQuery - among other great tools. Understanding how a design will be coded in the real world gives me valuable insight when working on a project.  </p>

						<h2>User Experience</h2>
						<p>These days, user experience must be considered every step of the way, not as just one piece of the puzzle. A well devised strategy will create a solid foundation for the UX of your product. I do this by first understanding the business goals as well as anticipating users needs. </p>

						<h2>Art Direction</h2>
						<p>In my opinion, the role of Art Director should be hands on. As Art Director I also act as Lead Designer. Working from sketch concepts to hi-fidelity designs. I can then direct a team to see through the overall vision of how something should look and feel.  </p>
