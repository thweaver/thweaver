			<p class="toggle-view">This design offered a unique challenge - generally with concert venues, ticket sales are the ultimate goal of the site - but at the time this site was designed, ticket sales had not yet begun. The Idea was to instead, use the website to showcase the venue itself. Once the venue opened, the focus of the site shifted to be more event driven - but the overall showcase concept remained the same.</p>

			<p class="toggle-view">My role for this project was to design the overall look and feel of the website. Going through multiple iterations and revisions with the client before settling into a clean modern interface, with a minimal color scheme.</p>
