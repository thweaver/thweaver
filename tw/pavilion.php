			<p class="toggle-view">This design offered a unique challenge - generally with Concert Venues, ticket sales was the ultimate goal. But at the time this site was designed and built, the venue was still not open and no tickets were on sale. The Idea was to instad showcase the venue itself. Once the venue opened, the focus of the site shifted to be more event driven. But the overall showcase concept remained the same.</p>

			<p class="toggle-view">My role for this project was to design the overall look and feel of the website. Going through multiple iterations and revisions with the client before settling into a clean modern interface, with a minimal color scheme.</p>
